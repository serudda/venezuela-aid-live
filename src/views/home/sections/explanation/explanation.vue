      <p class="pt-2 mb-4">Venezuela is suffering. Not that long ago, it was the wealthiest 
        country in South America. Now it is facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere. 
        Over 3 million Venezuelans have been displaced in the region – a number that is growing every day. 
        There is no food; the health system is crumbling; and millions are feeling the impacts, 
        many of them children and old people.</p> 
      <p class="pt-2">Despite this situation armed forces of Venezuela 
      under the power of Maduro don’t want the aids to enter to the country, together 
      we can change that and demonstrate the world the power of union and organization.</p>
